# Divide and Conquer, Sorting and Searching, and Randomized Algorithms

by Stanford University

## About this Course

The primary topics in this part of the specialization are: asymptotic ("Big-oh") notation, sorting and searching, divide and conquer (master method, integer and matrix multiplication, closest pair), and randomized algorithms (QuickSort, contraction algorithm for min cuts).

## Project
Calculate the minimum number of cuts by choosing random contraction edges. I implemented this with multithreaded Rust.
