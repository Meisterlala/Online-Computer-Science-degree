# Greedy Algorithms, Minimum Spanning Trees, and Dynamic Programming

by Stanford University

## About this Course

The primary topics in this part of the specialization are: greedy algorithms (scheduling, minimum spanning trees, clustering, Huffman codes) and dynamic programming (knapsack, sequence alignment, optimal search trees).

### Week 1

Two motivating applications; selected review; introduction to greedy algorithms; a scheduling application; Prim's MST algorithm.

Prim's MST algorithm was used to convert a 500 Node 2500 Edge Graph into a minimum spanning tree.

### Week 2

Kruskal's MST algorithm and applications to clustering; advanced union-find.
