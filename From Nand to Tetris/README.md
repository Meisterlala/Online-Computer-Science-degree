# Build a Modern Computer from First Principles: From Nand to Tetris
by Hebrew University of Jerusalem

# Project-Centered course
1. Project: Building elementary logic gates like And, Or, Not, Multiplexor, and more
2. Project: Building a family of adder chips, culminating in the construction of an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)
3. Project: Building registers and memory units, culminating in the construction of a Random Access Memory (RAM)
4. Project: Learning a machine language and using it to write some illustrative low-level programs
5. Project: Using the chipset built in projects 1-3 to build a Central Processing Unit (CPU) and a hardware platform capable of executing programs written in the machine language introduced in project 4
6. Project: Developing an assembler, i.e. a capability to translate programs written in symbolic machine language into binary, executable code.
