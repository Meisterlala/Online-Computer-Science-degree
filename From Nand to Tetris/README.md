I developed 2 compilers while taking this course. They require Python3.9 and can be installed with the commands below.

Compatible with Python3.9


## Jack Compiler
a compiler for the Jack programming language to Jack VM code (similar to Java bytecode).

[Source Code](/From%20Nand%20to%20Tetris/projects/10/JackCompiler/jackc/)

```
pip install "git+https://github.com/Meisterlala/Online-Computer-Science-degree/#egg=Jack-Compiler&subdirectory=From Nand to Tetris/projects/11/JackCompiler"
JackC (file|directory)
```

## Jack VM Translator
a compiler used to translate Jack VM code to Hack Assembly.

[Source Code](/From%20Nand%20to%20Tetris/projects/08/VMTranslator/translator/)

```
pip install "git+https://github.com/Meisterlala/Online-Computer-Science-degree/#egg=VMTranslator&subdirectory=From Nand to Tetris/projects/08/VMTranslator"
VMTranslator (file|directory)
```

### Project-Centered course
1. Project: Building elementary logic gates like And, Or, Not, Multiplexor, and more
2. Project: Building a family of adder chips, culminating in the construction of an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)
3. Project: Building registers and memory units, culminating in the construction of a Random Access Memory (RAM)
4. Project: Learning a machine language and using it to write some illustrative low-level programs
5. Project: Using the chipset built in projects 1-3 to build a Central Processing Unit (CPU) and a hardware platform capable of executing programs written in the machine language introduced in project 4
6. Project: Developing an assembler, i.e. a capability to translate programs written in symbolic machine language into binary, executable code.
