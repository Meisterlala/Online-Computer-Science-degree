;; Element is (make-elt String Integer ListOfElement)
;; interp. An element in the file system, with name, and EITHER data or subs.
;;         If data is 0, then subs is considered to be list of sub elements.
;;         If data is not 0, then subs is ignored.

;; ListOfElement is one of:
;;  - empty
;;  - (cons Element ListOfElement)
;; interp. A list of file system Elements
